# Luca re-run cases
- For the past month or so I have been running cases which Luca provided me
- I didn't realise that he had an edge neutral source turned on
- I turned this off when I was running the EIRENE cases however forgot when I was doing this study
- These cases are run without this edge source. This is indeed has made a massive difference
